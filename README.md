# Setup Guide
1. Install `python3.8` and the corresponding `pip3` version. This will vary from distribution to distribution. Consult [Python's documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or your distribution's documentation for help.
1. Install `pipenv`. Typically this is done by running `pip3 install pipenv`.
1. From this directory, run `pipenv install` to install dependencies. 
1. Next, run `pipenv run build` to compile as a stand-alone executable to `./dist/rpn`. 
1. You can freely move and/or run this executable directly.
